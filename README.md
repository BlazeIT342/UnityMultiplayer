# UnityMultiplayer
## Idea
My aim was to learn how to add **Multiplayer** in games. 

## About
That's a project where you and other people can create a server, join to it and play together. 

(*It's not a game, just showing **Multiplayer** features*).


### Project contains : 
* Unity Relay
* Netcode for GameObjects
* Lobbies
* Server Rpc

Also, the project was created thanks to ***CodeMonkey Assets***.
